The game currently will run on local network unless the server.py is hosted on online server.

change the ip address in both server and network file to the local ip address of the machine where server.py will be running. run ipconfig/ifconfig on cmd/terminal to get the ip address

Run server.py first and then run client.py on any device connected to same local network. When two clients are connected the game will start.
